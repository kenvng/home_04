	<h1>Classes and IDs</h1>

	<p>Say we have a notification to style, with an id of <code id="notification">notification</code>.<p>

	<div id="div1">
  		This has an <strong>id</strong> of <code id="notification">notification</code>, so it is selected in CSS with <code id="notification">#notification</code>. Check it out.
	</div>

	<p>But what if we have many messages on the page which are meant to look similar?</p>

	<div id="div2">
  		This is in an element with a <strong>class</strong> of <code class="message">message</code>, so it can be selected in CSS with <code class="message">.message</code>.
	</div>

	<div id="div3">
  		This is in another element with a <strong>class</strong> of <code class="message" class="message">message</code>, so it gets styled too.
	</div>

	<div id="div4">
  		A third element with a <strong>class</strong> of <code class="message">message</code>, for good measure. One CSS selector styles all of these.
	</div>

	<h2>IDs are singular, Classes are plural</h2>

	<p>An ID is meant to be used only once in a given HTML document. A given element can have only one ID.</p>

	<p>A class can be reused as many times as needed in a given HTML document. A given element can have multiple classes.</p>

	<h2>Using Multiple Classes</h2>

	<p>An element can be given multiple classes, separated by spaces, such as <code class="foo">class="foo bar baz"</code>.</p>

	<div id="div5">
 		This has <code class="message error">class="message error"</code>, meaning it has two classes: <code class="message error">message</code> and <code class="message error">error</code>. It will get styles from <code class="message error">.message</code> and <code class="message error">.error</code>. The styles for <code class="message error">.error</code> override the default styles, which we achieve by placing them after the styles for <code class="message error">.message</code>.
	</div>

	<h2>Your Turn</h2>

	<p>Create two new divs on the page with the class "message". Add an additional class of "error" to one container and an additonal class of "success" to the other. When both classes (message + success) are together, how do you want it to look? What about if (message + error) are grouped together? What styles are consistent for both containers that you can leave in the CSS rule for "message"?</p>

	<div class="message error">
		ERROR: Create two new divs on the page with the class "message". Add an additional class of "error" to one container and an additonal class of "success" to the other.
